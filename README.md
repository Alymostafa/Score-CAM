# Official implementation for Score-CAM

## Update
**`2019.4.13`**: First version of Score-CAM code has been released. More implementations will be added later.

## Milestone
* Support for Colab notebook.
* Support for faster version of Score-CAM.
* Support for pre-trained model in Pytorch.
* Support for self-defined model in Pytorch.
* Add visualization result and quantitive evaluation.

## Implement Score-CAM into popular visualization tools.
It would be very appreciated for implementing Score-CAM for other popular projects, if any of you are interested.
* Implement in [pytorch/captum](https://github.com/pytorch/captum)
* Implement in [PAIR-code/saliency](https://github.com/PAIR-code/saliency)
* Implement in [utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations)

## Other implementations
Before we release the official code, some great researchers have implemented Score-CAM on different framework. 
I am very grateful for the efforts made in their implementation.
